### Environment variables

If you want to use environment variables modify .env.example contents acordingly and copy to new file named as follows:

```bash
.env                # loaded in all cases
.env.local          # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]         # only loaded in specified mode
.env.[mode].local   # only loaded in specified mode, ignored by git
```

For example, to use variables for emulator mode (npm run serve emulator) and ignored by git name it ".dev.emulator.local"
